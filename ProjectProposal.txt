Games Engine 1 Assignment

This is my project proposal for games engine 1. For my project, I plan to create a virtual simulation where the user can explore the sea. 
The user will either be a fish object, submarine or a scuba diver. I will have various fish and aquatic swimming through the water to give
the user a cool experience and to explore the depth of the unknown.
