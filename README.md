# Proposal

My goal for this assignment is to make an exploration-type of stimulation. I am not 100% sure of what kind of stimulation I will create, but as of now, I̶ ̶w̶o̶u̶l̶d̶ ̶l̶i̶k̶e̶ ̶t̶o̶ ̶c̶r̶e̶a̶t̶e̶ ̶a̶ ̶s̶u̶b̶m̶a̶r̶i̶n̶e̶ ̶t̶h̶a̶t̶ ̶e̶x̶p̶l̶o̶r̶e̶s̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶d̶e̶e̶p̶ ̶w̶a̶t̶e̶r̶s̶.̶ ̶I̶f̶ ̶n̶o̶t̶ ̶a̶ ̶s̶u̶b̶m̶a̶r̶i̶n̶e̶,̶ ̶I̶ ̶w̶i̶l̶l̶ ̶i̶m̶p̶l̶e̶m̶e̶n̶t̶ ̶a̶ ̶s̶c̶u̶b̶a̶ ̶d̶i̶v̶e̶r̶ ̶o̶r̶ ̶s̶o̶m̶e̶t̶h̶i̶n̶g̶ ̶r̶e̶l̶a̶t̶e̶d̶ ̶t̶o̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶e̶x̶p̶e̶r̶i̶e̶n̶c̶e̶. After re-reading the assignment brief, I have decided to change my idea into exploring a forrest terrain. I may make it a forest where the player can explore the wilderness. I have decided to change my idea as I believe this idea would be better suited in relation to procedural generation. I could generate trees, structures and animals (something along the lines of minecraft).
