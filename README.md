# Description of the project
I have created a mountain-like terrain with trees with the help of perlin noise. Basically, when the user presses the play button, he/she is able to move along the terrain using the FPSController asset which I downloaded from the Standard Asset Package. As the player moves along, more terrain is generated based on the user's position. Trees are also generated in that direction making this project a type of exploration simulator.

# Instructions for use
1. Press play button
2. Move using WASD/ UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT arrow (Space to jump)
3. Use mouse to move camera 

# How it works
This project works by creating a tiles and trees based on the user's x and z position. The trees are stored in a array and set to inactive. Based on the user's position, if he/she moves in a certain direction, new tiles are created and the trees that are located on that tile are set to active. This makes the game, generate more tiles with trees which constantly expands the terrain.

# What I am most proud of in the assignment
I am proud of how the terrain looks in my project. As I have never done C# before, I needed a lot of help in order with work in Unity. However, I was able to generate a terrain filled with trees based on movement from the user which was pretty good. I could easily expand this project into a bigger terrain filled with animals and chests and such (in terms of a game).

# Proposal submitted earlier can go here:
My goal for this assignment is to make an exploration-type of stimulation. I am not 100% sure of what kind of stimulation I will create, but as of now, I̶ ̶w̶o̶u̶l̶d̶ ̶l̶i̶k̶e̶ ̶t̶o̶ ̶c̶r̶e̶a̶t̶e̶ ̶a̶ ̶s̶u̶b̶m̶a̶r̶i̶n̶e̶ ̶t̶h̶a̶t̶ ̶e̶x̶p̶l̶o̶r̶e̶s̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶d̶e̶e̶p̶ ̶w̶a̶t̶e̶r̶s̶.̶ ̶I̶f̶ ̶n̶o̶t̶ ̶a̶ ̶s̶u̶b̶m̶a̶r̶i̶n̶e̶,̶ ̶I̶ ̶w̶i̶l̶l̶ ̶i̶m̶p̶l̶e̶m̶e̶n̶t̶ ̶a̶ ̶s̶c̶u̶b̶a̶ ̶d̶i̶v̶e̶r̶ ̶o̶r̶ ̶s̶o̶m̶e̶t̶h̶i̶n̶g̶ ̶r̶e̶l̶a̶t̶e̶d̶ ̶t̶o̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶e̶x̶p̶e̶r̶i̶e̶n̶c̶e̶. After re-reading the assignment brief, I have decided to change my idea into exploring a forrest terrain. I may make it a forest where the player can explore the wilderness. I have decided to change my idea as I believe this idea would be better suited in relation to procedural generation. I could generate trees, structures and animals (something along the lines of minecraft)
