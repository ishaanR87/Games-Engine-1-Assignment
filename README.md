# Proposal

My goal for this assignment is to make an exploration-type of stimulation. I am not 100% sure of what kind of stimulation I will create, but as of now, I would like to create a submarine that explores the deep waters. If not a submarine, I will implement a scuba diver or something related to the experience. I will try to implement animals or shapes under the water to scenic experience exploring the depth of the unknown.
